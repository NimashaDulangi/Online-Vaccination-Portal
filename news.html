         Meanwhile, the island’s new infections rose to an all time high for the third day running yesterday with over 1,900 cases reported.Fernandopulle said this was an alarming rise as people should be more vigilant to practice COVID-19 health guidelines."They must stay indoors as far as possible by stopping all unnecessary travel. If needed only one person can go out of a home”, she said.The health authorities have dubbed this new wave the ‘New Year cluster’ which came to strike with the milling shoppers for the traditional Sinhala and Tamil New Year mid last month. The number of cases which stood below 200 per day average prior to the New Year celebrations in April had now reached nearly 2,000 per day, authorities said.
